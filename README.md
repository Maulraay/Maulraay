👋 Hi, I'm Malaury Keslick - a French Web & Software Engineer passionate about building useful, elegant, and privacy-conscious web solutions.

🚀 I'm currently based in Swiss, near the Liechtenstein border and looking for opportunities in this region or remotely.

🌐 My public repository showcases my personal portfolio, built with:
- **React**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**
- Modern UI patterns and responsive design
- Deployed using **Netlify**

🧠 In my professional experience, I’ve worked on AI-powered chatbots, large-scale enterprise web apps, and internal tooling using:
- **MERN stack**, **Vue.js**, **TypeScript**, **Python**
- Cloud services: **IBM Watson**, **AWS**, **Google Cloud**
- Tools like **Storybook**, **Docker**, **Git**, **Openshift**, **Jenkins**

💡 I aim to build efficient, intuitive interfaces that help people get things done - instead of systems that fight for their attention.
